                <p>Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together.</p>
                <p>Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed.
                Often, programmers fall in love with Python because of the increased productivity it provides. Since there is no compilation step, the edit-test-debug cycle is incredibly fast. Debugging Python programs is easy:</p>

                The number of features in the language itself is modest, requiring relatively little investment of time or effort to produce your first programs.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Python syntax is designed to be readable and straightforward. This simplicity makes Python an ideal teaching language, and it lets newcomers pick it up quickly. As a result, developers spend more time thinking about the problem theyâ€™re trying to solve and less time thinking about language complexities or deciphering code left by others.

                    To get started with writing Python, open your scratchpad and write your very first "Hello World!" Python code:
                </p>
                <code>print("Hello World!")</code>
            </article>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Python_commands">
            <header id="header">Python commands</header>
            <article>
                <p>Whenever you are done in the python command line, you can simply type the following to quit the python command line interface:</p>
                <code>exit()</code>
                <p>Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.</p>
                <code>if 5 > 2:<br>
                    print("Five is greater than two!")</code>
                <p>In Python, variables are created when you assign a value to it:</p>
                <code>x = 5<br>
                    y = "Hello, World!"</code>
                <p>Comments start with a #, and Python will render the rest of the line as a comment:</p>
                <code>#This is a comment.<br>
                    print("Hello, World!")</code>
